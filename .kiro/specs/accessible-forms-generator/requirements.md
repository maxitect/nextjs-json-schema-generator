# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current forms generator produces React form components with significant accessibility violations that prevent users with disabilities from effectively using the application. This feature will redesign the forms generator to create WCAG 2.2 AA compliant form components that provide an inclusive user experience while maintaining the existing JSON-driven architecture and DaisyUI styling framework.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Form Labelling and Structure

**User Story:** As a screen reader user, I want form components to have proper semantic structure and labeling, so that I can navigate and understand form content efficiently.

#### Code Example

```typescript
<fieldset className="space-y-4">
  <legend className="text-lg font-semibold">Basic Information</legend>
  <div className="form-control">
    <label htmlFor="name-input" className="label">
      <span className="label-text">Amenity Name *</span>
    </label>
    <input
      id="name-input"
      type="text"
      className="input input-bordered"
      aria-required="true"
      aria-describedby="name-error name-help"
      {...register("name")}
    />
    <div id="name-help" className="label">
      <span className="label-text-alt">
        Enter a descriptive name for the amenity
      </span>
    </div>
    {errors.name && (
      <div id="name-error" className="label" role="alert">
        <span className="label-text-alt text-error">{errors.name.message}</span>
      </div>
    )}
  </div>
</fieldset>
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form fields are grouped by section THEN each section SHALL be wrapped in a fieldset with a descriptive legend element
2. WHEN a form input is rendered THEN it SHALL have an explicitly associated label using htmlFor and matching id attributes
3. WHEN form validation errors occur THEN error messages SHALL be programmatically associated with inputs using aria-describedby
4. WHEN help text is provided THEN it SHALL be associated with the input using aria-describedby
5. WHEN multiple descriptive elements exist for an input THEN aria-describedby SHALL reference all relevant IDs in a space-separated list
6. WHEN required fields are present THEN they SHALL use aria-required="true" instead of just visual indicators

### Requirement 2: Focus Management and Indicators

**User Story:** As a keyboard user, I want form components to have proper focus management and visual indicators, so that I can navigate forms efficiently without a mouse.

#### Code Example

```typescript
className =
  "focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-blue-500 focus-visible:ring-offset-2";

// Focus management on validation errors
useEffect(() => {
  if (Object.keys(errors).length > 0) {
    const firstErrorField = Object.keys(errors)[0];
    const element = document.getElementById(`${firstErrorField}-input`);
    element?.focus();
  }
}, [errors]);
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates with keyboard THEN all interactive elements SHALL have visible focus indicators that meet 3:1 contrast ratio
2. WHEN form validation fails THEN focus SHALL move to the first field with an error
3. WHEN custom form controls are used THEN they SHALL support standard keyboard navigation patterns
4. WHEN forms are submitted THEN focus SHALL be managed appropriately based on success or failure state
5. WHEN focus indicators are customized THEN they SHALL remain visible and meet contrast requirements

### Requirement 3: Touch Target Size (WCAG 2.2)

**User Story:** As a user with motor disabilities, I want form controls to meet touch target size requirements, so that I can interact with forms on mobile devices.

#### Code Example

```typescript
className = "min-h-[24px] min-w-[24px] p-3";
// Ensure adequate spacing between targets
className = "space-y-4"; // Minimum spacing between form elements
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interactive form elements are rendered THEN they SHALL meet minimum 24px touch target size (WCAG 2.2 standard)
2. WHEN form buttons are generated THEN they SHALL have adequate spacing between adjacent interactive elements
3. WHEN form controls are small by design THEN they SHALL have sufficient padding to meet touch target requirements
4. WHEN forms are used on mobile devices THEN all interactive elements SHALL remain accessible and usable
5. WHEN multiple buttons are adjacent THEN they SHALL have sufficient spacing to prevent accidental activation

### Requirement 4: Live Regions and Dynamic Content

**User Story:** As a user of assistive technology, I want dynamic form content to be properly announced, so that I'm aware of changes and updates in real-time.

#### Code Example

```typescript
<div aria-live="polite" className="sr-only">
  {submitStatus && `Form ${submitStatus}`}
</div>;

// Error announcements
{
  errors.name && (
    <div id="name-error" className="label" role="alert" aria-live="assertive">
      <span className="label-text-alt text-error">{errors.name.message}</span>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form validation errors appear THEN they SHALL be announced via aria-live="assertive" or role="alert"
2. WHEN form submission status changes THEN updates SHALL be communicated through aria-live="polite" regions
3. WHEN dynamic content is added or removed from forms THEN changes SHALL be announced to screen readers
4. WHEN form data is being processed THEN loading states SHALL use appropriate ARIA attributes and live announcements
5. WHEN form fields are conditionally shown/hidden THEN visibility changes SHALL be handled accessibly

### Requirement 5: Semantic HTML Structure

**User Story:** As a screen reader user, I want forms to use proper semantic HTML elements instead of generic divs, so that I can navigate efficiently using landmark navigation.

#### Code Example

```typescript
// Replace current structure:
<div className="card bg-base-100 shadow-sm">
  <div className="card-body">
    <h3 className="card-title text-lg">Basic Information</h3>

// With semantic structure:
<fieldset className="card bg-base-100 shadow-sm">
  <div className="card-body">
    <legend className="card-title text-lg">Basic Information</legend>
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form sections are generated THEN they SHALL use fieldset and legend elements instead of div and h3
2. WHEN form components are created THEN they SHALL NOT include page-level elements like h1 or main
3. WHEN form groups are rendered THEN they SHALL use appropriate semantic grouping elements
4. WHEN forms are integrated into pages THEN they SHALL maintain proper heading hierarchy without creating multiple h1 elements
5. WHEN complex forms are generated THEN they SHALL use semantic HTML to create logical document structure

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a user with cognitive disabilities, I want form components to provide clear, specific error messages and validation feedback, so that I can successfully complete forms without confusion.

#### Code Example

```typescript
// Custom validation with specific messages
formRef.current.checkValidity();
setCustomValidity(
  "Please enter a valid email address in the format: user@example.com"
);

// Specific error messages instead of generic ones
const validationRules = {
  required: "Amenity name is required to save this item",
  minLength: {
    value: 2,
    message: "Amenity name must be at least 2 characters long",
  },
  pattern: {
    value: /^[a-zA-Z\s]+$/,
    message: "Amenity name can only contain letters and spaces",
  },
};
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form validation errors occur THEN error messages SHALL be specific and actionable rather than generic
2. WHEN validation fails THEN error messages SHALL provide clear guidance on how to fix the issue
3. WHEN form submission is in progress THEN loading states SHALL be announced to assistive technologies
4. WHEN custom validation is needed THEN the generator SHALL provide hooks for accessible custom validation messages
5. WHEN multiple validation errors exist THEN they SHALL be presented in a logical order with clear association to their fields

### Requirement 7: Screen Reader Utilities and Hidden Content

**User Story:** As a screen reader user, I want important information to be available to my assistive technology while avoiding unnecessary visual clutter for sighted users.

#### Code Example

```typescript
className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only focus:absolute focus:top-4 focus:left-4"

// Screen reader announcements for form state
<div className="sr-only" aria-live="polite">
  {isSubmitting ? "Submitting form data..." : ""}
  {submitSuccess ? "Form submitted successfully" : ""}
</div>
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN forms include supplementary information THEN it SHALL use sr-only classes appropriately for screen reader users
2. WHEN form state changes occur THEN important updates SHALL be announced via screen reader-only content
3. WHEN visual indicators are used THEN equivalent text alternatives SHALL be provided for screen readers
4. WHEN forms are processing THEN screen reader users SHALL receive appropriate status updates
5. WHEN sr-only content is used THEN it SHALL serve a specific accessibility purpose without hiding essential visible content

### Requirement 8: Motion and Animation Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user with vestibular disorders, I want form animations and transitions to respect my motion preferences, so that I can use forms without experiencing discomfort or disorientation.

#### Code Example

```typescript
className="motion-reduce:hidden motion-safe:animate-pulse"
className="transition-colors motion-reduce:transition-none"

// Respect user preferences for reduced motion
<button className="btn btn-primary motion-safe:hover:scale-105 motion-reduce:hover:scale-100">
  Submit
</button>
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN forms include animations or transitions THEN they SHALL respect prefers-reduced-motion settings
2. WHEN loading indicators are shown THEN they SHALL have reduced-motion alternatives
3. WHEN form state changes include visual effects THEN motion-reduce alternatives SHALL be provided
4. WHEN hover effects are applied THEN they SHALL be conditional based on motion preferences
5. WHEN forms include auto-playing animations THEN they SHALL be disabled for users who prefer reduced motion
